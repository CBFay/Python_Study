# Cython
### C Extension for Python
Using Cython's static type declarations, you can compile Python code as C code.  

'Cythonizing' .py code means that it is re-written in the C language.  

The Python interpreter dynamically checks the type of variables each time they are referenced, so being able to explicitly declare types yields dramatic performance gains.
