# checkIPs

### Problem
Given a list of strings, return a corresponding list of strings indicating whether each given was an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or neither.

### Notes  
-checkIPs.py contains the initial solution that I provided in a time sensitive setting. 

-From a (slightly) less naive perspective, I would provide the solution found in checkIPs.py, which I think is more succinct, and makes responsible use of the Python Standard Library, which I declined to consult during the time of this challenge.
