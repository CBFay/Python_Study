# checkIPs

Given a list of strings, return a corresponding list of strings indicating whether each given was an IPv4, IPv6, or neither.

checkIPs.py contains a a solution that I provided in a time sensitive setting. 

From a (slightly) less naive perspective, I would provide the solution found in checkIPs.py, which I think is more succinct, and makes responsible use of the Python Standard Library, which was at my disposal during the time of this challenge.
